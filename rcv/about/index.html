				<h2>Who We Are</h2>
				<p>In 2004, RCV volunteers took in more than 205 raptors for treatment. All RCV raptor rehabilitation is done in close consultation with two highly qualified veterinarians who perform surgery, take x-rays, prescribe medications, and do prerelease physicals for raptor patients. Trained and experienced RCV volunteers handle emergency treatment of injured raptors, recuperative care, administration of medications, feeding, conditioning and, in over half the cases in 2004, release to the wild of birds performing at a skill level acceptable for release.</p>
				<p>RCV volunteers in 2004 also gave over 200 education presentations utilizing non-releasiable raptors to more than 140,000 people, for local schools, scout functions, community events, and other groups. RCV education programs present information about the need to preserve habitat, the value of predators in the balance of nature, the characteristics of native Virginia raptor species. The existence of state and federal laws protecting raptors from interference by humans, and the need for permits, are also emphasized. Allowing people to see some of our native raptors up close helps them to appreciate just how magnificent and special these birds are.</p>
				<h2>Educational Programs</h2>
				<p>RCV education presentations utilize the display of live, non-releaseable raptors to inform children and adults about native wildlife, raptor rehabilitation, preservation of habitat, and respect for our wild neighbors. Slides may be used to enhance the presentation or increase audience awareness. Raptor biology is a main focus, although the subject matter will vary depending on the audience background, age and interests. We have found that allowing people to see some of our native raptors up close helps increase both appreciation of these wonderful birds and understanding of their place in the wild.</p>
				<p>We discuss the work involved in caring for 250 new raptor patients a year, in addition to the RCV resident birds. Throughout our programs we stress our close connection with nature and the need for humans to responsibly manage natural resources, including wildlife. We will work with teachers to help them integrate these subjects into their curriculum, and to stimulate student interest in academic subjects.</p>
				<p>Amount requested will be determined by the number of people attending and the length of program(s).</p>
				<p>All programs will include one or more live raptors, and may include the use of slides or audiovisual material. For substantial trips away from the RCV facilities, reimbursement for the cost of transportation may also be requested.</p>
				<p>All donations received by the RCV from presentations directly support the feeding, housing, and medical care of the raptors cared for by the RCV.</p>
				<p>Call RCV to discuss and schedule a presentation! The telephone number is 703-578-1175. Ask Kent Knowles, who arranges RCV raptor presentations, for information and availability for your group!</p>
